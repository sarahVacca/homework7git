 This assignment was very hard and confusing. We spent a lot of time trying just to get started with running the example apps. Each step of this assignment was a struggle. We felt that we could've used a lot more direction and help in getting started with the example apps and with building our own web app. We had to spend multiple hours searching google trying to understand how to use the commands in the terminal. We were not able to complete the assignment in time because we could not figure out how to get our showStudentsPage working.
